# This is a transition probability matrix for month of May using weather@home batch 793 at [-43.372, 172.333]
# monthly classified data retreived from 1_bias_corrected_all_months_classified_v2.csv 
# The columns represent class for the month of May 
# The rows represent the class for the next month 
# The values represent the probability of that transition, with the column being the initial state and the row being the next state 
# Column and row labels represent all the possible combinations of temp and precip classes (H,D,AT) and (W,D,AP)
